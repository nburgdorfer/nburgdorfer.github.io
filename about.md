I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at <a href="https://www.stevens.edu/schaefer-school-engineering-science/departments/computer-science" target="_blank">Stevens Institue of Technology</a>. I work in the Computer Vision Lab with Professor <a href="https://mordohai.github.io/" target="_blank">Philippos Mordohai</a>, with my work focusing on Muliple-View 3D Reconstruction, Binocular Stereo, and Depth Map Fusion.<br />

In December 2020, I received my Masters in Machine Learning from Stevens Institute of Technology.<br />

I received my Bachelors in Computer Science from Stevens Institute of Technology in May 2020.<br />
